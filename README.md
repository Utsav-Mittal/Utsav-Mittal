*Hello*, I am **Utsav Mittal**, a sophomore in high school.
I go by **he/him** pronouns. 
I **don't have much previous coding experience**, other than some exposure I have had in my time in middle school at GA, however I do have some basic experience in javascript with P5.js. 
I wanted to take this class to **explore different things**. Computer science is pretty far out of my comfort zone, but is something that can defintely proove useful. It also a way to add variety to my schedule. 
Some of my interests include:
  1. waterpolo
  2. videogames
  3. tv 
  4. shows 
  5. movies
  6. reading novels. 
Some of my **goals** for this class are to create at least one game, one interactive scene, and be able to create things that the person running the program can interact with.
